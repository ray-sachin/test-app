# Starter SPA (Home + About) — Round 3

## Overview
This is a lightweight single-page web app that now includes:
- A new About page, accessible at the hash route #/about.
- A cohesive CSS stylesheet (embedded in index.html) that provides a responsive, accessible UI.

The app uses minimal vanilla JavaScript to handle hash-based routing between the Home and About views. No frameworks or build tools are required.

## Setup
- No installation needed.
- Download or clone the repository and open index.html in any modern web browser.

Optional: Serve locally (useful for testing in some browsers):
- With Python: python3 -m http.server 8080
- Then visit: http://localhost:8080

## Usage
- Navigate via the header links:
  - Home: #/
  - About: #/about
- You can bookmark or directly open index.html#/about to jump straight to the About page.
- The main content area updates without a full page reload. Keyboard users can use the “Skip to content” link for quicker navigation.
