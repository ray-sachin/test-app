# Hello World Web App

## Overview
A minimal, zero-dependency web app that displays “Hello World” in a clean, centered card with subtle styling. This version adds a “Show Alert” button that triggers a browser alert when clicked. Everything runs entirely in the browser—no build tools required.

## Setup
1. Download the two files (index.html and README.md) into the same folder.
2. No installation is needed.

Optional: Serve locally for best results
- Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000`
- Node (http-server): `npx http-server -p 8000`

## Usage
- Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
- You will see the “Hello World” message centered on the page.
- Click the “Show Alert” button to see a browser alert.
- You can also focus the button with Tab and press Enter or Space to trigger the alert.

## Improvements from previous version (Round 2)
- Added a “Show Alert” button that displays a browser alert when clicked.
- Enhanced styling and focus states for better usability and accessibility.
- Kept the app zero-dependency and runnable with a single HTML file.
